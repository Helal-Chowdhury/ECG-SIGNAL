### Introduction
In this project, A template has been made for any general purpose Image Classifications problems. The project folder consists of three folders: _IMAGE_COLLECTION_FOLDERS_, _BACKEND, and _FRONEND_. For demonstration, I choose  five fruit classes. However, you can choose any class of images by using Hugging face image collection API. I use Pytorch, and Streamlit for training and deployment. Pre-trained Models: Resnet18 and Densnet109 models. However, you can find tons of pre-trained image classification models from
