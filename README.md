### Introduction
In this project, Five different types of ECG beats are taken into account to classify:
 - Non-ecotic beats
 - Supraventricular ectopic beats
 - Ventricular ectopic beats
 - Fusion beats
 - Unknown beats

I am not expert in analyzing __ECG__ signal but have background in signal processing. So, my basic intiution regarding the  __ECG__ that ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography)) a heart beat is segmented into
__P,Q,R,S,T__. and its intervals. The duration and the magnitude of those segments may be used to identify the type of __ECG__ beat as mentioned before.
